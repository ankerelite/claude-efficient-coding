## 🚀 Project Overview

This project showcases a novel technique for instructing AI language models (specifically Claude) to generate highly optimized, efficient code. The approach is demonstrated through a fully-functional idle game featuring:

- Real-time particle physics
- Complex game mechanics
- Resource management
- Visual effects
- All in a single, optimized codebase

## 📖 Key Features

- **Ultra-Efficient Code Generation**: Novel prompting techniques for AI that result in extremely optimized code
- **Advanced Game Mechanics**: Complete game system with upgrades, particle effects, and resource management
- **Innovative AI Interaction**: New paradigm for teaching AI models to generate efficient code

## 💻 Technical Stack

- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Canvas API
- Claude AI

## 🎯 Key Optimization Techniques

```javascript
// Traditional approach
const gameConfig = {
    units: [{
        identifier: 'cart',
        name: 'Mining Cart',
        cost: 15
    }]
}

// Optimized approach
const G={U:[{i:'c',n:'Cart',c:15}]}
```
